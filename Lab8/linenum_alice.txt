0007: CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole
0008: 
0009: Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
0010: bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
0011: book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
0012: it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or
0013: conversations?'
0014: 
0015: So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
0016: hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
0017: of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
0018: picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
0019: close by her.
0020: 
0021: There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
0022: VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!
0023: Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it
0024: occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
0025: it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH
0026: OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
0027: Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
0028: never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch
0029: to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
0030: after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
0031: rabbit-hole under the hedge.
0032: 
0033: In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
0034: in the world she was to get out again.
0035: 
0036: The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
0037: dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
0038: about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
0039: well.
0040: 
0041: Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
0042: plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was
0043: going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what
0044: she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
0045: looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
0046: cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
0047: hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as
0048: she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great
0049: disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
0050: of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
0051: she fell past it.
0052: 
0053: 'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall
0054: think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at
0055: home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top
0056: of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)
0057: 
0058: Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how
0059: many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting
0060: somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
0061: thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several
0062: things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
0063: was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there
0064: was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)
0065: '--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude
0066: or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or
0067: Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
0068: 
0069: Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the
0070: earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with
0071: their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad
0072: there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the
0073: right word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country
0074: is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and
0075: she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling
0076: through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an
0077: ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to
0078: ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'
0079: 
0080: Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
0081: talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'
0082: (Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at
0083: tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no
0084: mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very
0085: like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice
0086: began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy
0087: sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do
0088: bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,
0089: it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing
0090: off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with
0091: Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:
0092: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon
0093: a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
0094: 
0095: Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
0096: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
0097: long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
0098: There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and
0099: was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears
0100: and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she
0101: turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
0102: herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
0103: from the roof.
0104: 
0105: There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
0106: Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
0107: door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
0108: get out again.
0109: 
0110: Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
0111: glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's
0112: first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
0113: but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
0114: but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
0115: time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
0116: behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
0117: little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
0118: 
0119: Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
0120: much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage
0121: into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of
0122: that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and
0123: those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the
0124: doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it
0125: would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could
0126: shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.'
0127: For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,
0128: that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
0129: impossible.
0130: 
0131: There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
0132: back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
0133: any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
0134: time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here
0135: before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
0136: label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large
0137: letters.
0138: 
0139: It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was
0140: not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and
0141: see whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice
0142: little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild
0143: beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember
0144: the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot
0145: poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your
0146: finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never
0147: forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is
0148: almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
0149: 
0150: However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste
0151: it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour
0152: of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot
0153: buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.
0154: 
0155: 'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a
0156: telescope.'
0157: 
0158: And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
0159: brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
0160: through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
0161: waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
0162: she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said
0163: Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder
0164: what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a
0165: candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember
0166: ever having seen such a thing.
0167: 
0168: After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
0169: into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
0170: door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
0171: went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
0172: it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
0173: best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
0174: and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
0175: sat down and cried.
0176: 
0177: 'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself,
0178: rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally
0179: gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
0180: and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
0181: her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
0182: cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
0183: for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
0184: 'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!
0185: Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'
0186: 
0187: Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
0188: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
0189: 'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said
0190: Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
0191: makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll
0192: get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'
0193: 
0194: She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which
0195: way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
0196: growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
0197: size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
0198: had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
0199: things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on
0200: in the common way.
0201: 
0202: So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.
0203: 
0204: 
0205: 
0206: 
0207: CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears
0208: 
0209: 'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
0210: for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm
0211: opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'
0212: (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
0213: sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder
0214: who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure
0215: _I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
0216: myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be
0217: kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want
0218: to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'
0219: 
0220: And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They must
0221: go by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending
0222: presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!
0223: 
0224:      ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.
0225:        HEARTHRUG,
0226:          NEAR THE FENDER,
0227:            (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).
0228: 
0229: Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'
0230: 
0231: Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
0232: now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
0233: key and hurried off to the garden door.
0234: 
0235: Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
0236: look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
0237: hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
0238: 
0239: 'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like
0240: you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way! Stop this
0241: moment, I tell you!' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
0242: tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches
0243: deep and reaching half down the hall.
0244: 
0245: After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
0246: she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
0247: Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in
0248: one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great
0249: hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!
0250: Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so
0251: desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit
0252: came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--'
0253: The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,
0254: and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
0255: 
0256: Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
0257: kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How
0258: queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
0259: I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
0260: same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a
0261: little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who
0262: in the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began thinking
0263: over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to
0264: see if she could have been changed for any of them.
0265: 
0266: 'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long
0267: ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't
0268: be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
0269: very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling
0270: it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me
0271: see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and
0272: four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!
0273: However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.
0274: London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and
0275: Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for
0276: Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"' and she crossed her
0277: hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,
0278: but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the
0279: same as they used to do:--
0280: 
0281:      'How doth the little crocodile
0282:       Improve his shining tail,
0283:      And pour the waters of the Nile
0284:       On every golden scale!
0285: 
0286:      'How cheerfully he seems to grin,
0287:       How neatly spread his claws,
0288:      And welcome little fishes in
0289:       With gently smiling jaws!'
0290: 
0291: 'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes
0292: filled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and
0293: I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
0294: no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've
0295: made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no
0296: use their putting their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I
0297: shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then,
0298: if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here
0299: till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst
0300: of tears, 'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired
0301: of being all alone here!'
0302: 
0303: As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
0304: that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while
0305: she was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I must
0306: be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure
0307: herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now
0308: about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found
0309: out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped
0310: it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
0311: 
0312: 'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
0313: sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and
0314: now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door:
0315: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was
0316: lying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,'
0317: thought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never!
0318: And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'
0319: 
0320: As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!
0321: she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she
0322: had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by
0323: railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
0324: her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
0325: to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
0326: sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
0327: of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon
0328: made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she
0329: was nine feet high.
0330: 
0331: 'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying
0332: to find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
0333: being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!
0334: However, everything is queer to-day.'
0335: 
0336: Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
0337: off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
0338: it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
0339: she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
0340: slipped in like herself.
0341: 
0342: 'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?
0343: Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
0344: likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she
0345: began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
0346: of swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right
0347: way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
0348: she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of
0349: a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather
0350: inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
0351: but it said nothing.
0352: 
0353: 'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's
0354: a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all
0355: her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
0356: anything had happened.) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which
0357: was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
0358: sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
0359: 'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt
0360: the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'
0361: 
0362: 'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would
0363: YOU like cats if you were me?'
0364: 
0365: 'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry
0366: about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd
0367: take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet
0368: thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
0369: pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and
0370: washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's
0371: such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried
0372: Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she
0373: felt certain it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her any
0374: more if you'd rather not.'
0375: 
0376: 'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
0377: tail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED
0378: cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'
0379: 
0380: 'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
0381: conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not
0382: answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near
0383: our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
0384: know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when
0385: you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
0386: of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,
0387: you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He
0388: says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful
0389: tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming
0390: away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in
0391: the pool as it went.
0392: 
0393: So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
0394: won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When the
0395: Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its
0396: face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
0397: trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
0398: history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'
0399: 
0400: It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
0401: birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,
0402: a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the
0403: way, and the whole party swam to the shore.
0404: 
0405: 
0406: 
0407: 
0408: CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
0409: 
0410: They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the
0411: birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
0412: to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
0413: 
0414: The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
0415: consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
0416: to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
0417: known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the
0418: Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than
0419: you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without
0420: knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its
0421: age, there was no more to be said.
0422: 
0423: At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
0424: called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you
0425: dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse
0426: in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt
0427: sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
0428: 
0429: 'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This
0430: is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! "William
0431: the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
0432: to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
0433: accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
0434: Mercia and Northumbria--"'
0435: 
0436: 'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.
0437: 
0438: 'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 'Did
0439: you speak?'
0440: 
0441: 'Not I!' said the Lory hastily.
0442: 
0443: 'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. "Edwin and Morcar,
0444: the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,
0445: the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--"'
0446: 
0447: 'Found WHAT?' said the Duck.
0448: 
0449: 'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what
0450: "it" means.'
0451: 
0452: 'I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said the
0453: Duck: 'it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
0454: archbishop find?'
0455: 
0456: The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '"--found
0457: it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
0458: crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his
0459: Normans--" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning
0460: to Alice as it spoke.
0461: 
0462: 'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to
0463: dry me at all.'
0464: 
0465: 'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move
0466: that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
0467: remedies--'
0468: 
0469: 'Speak English!' said the Eaglet. 'I don't know the meaning of half
0470: those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!' And
0471: the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
0472: tittered audibly.
0473: 
0474: 'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that
0475: the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'
0476: 
0477: 'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,
0478: but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,
0479: and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
0480: 
0481: 'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as
0482: you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell
0483: you how the Dodo managed it.)
0484: 
0485: First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact
0486: shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed
0487: along the course, here and there. There was no 'One, two, three, and
0488: away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
0489: liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
0490: when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,
0491: the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded
0492: round it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'
0493: 
0494: This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,
0495: and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead
0496: (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures
0497: of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,
0498: 'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.'
0499: 
0500: 'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked.
0501: 
0502: 'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;
0503: and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused
0504: way, 'Prizes! Prizes!'
0505: 
0506: Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
0507: pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
0508: not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one
0509: a-piece all round.
0510: 
0511: 'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.
0512: 
0513: 'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in
0514: your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.
0515: 
0516: 'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.
0517: 
0518: 'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.
0519: 
0520: Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
0521: presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant
0522: thimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.
0523: 
0524: Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
0525: that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
0526: to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
0527: could.
0528: 
0529: The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
0530: confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
0531: theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
0532: However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
0533: begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
0534: 
0535: 'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why
0536: it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
0537: would be offended again.
0538: 
0539: 'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
0540: sighing.
0541: 
0542: 'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at
0543: the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling
0544: about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was
0545: something like this:--
0546: 
0547:          'Fury said to a
0548:          mouse, That he
0549:         met in the
0550:        house,
0551:      "Let us
0552:       both go to
0553:        law: I will
0554:         prosecute
0555:          YOU.--Come,
0556:            I'll take no
0557:            denial; We
0558:           must have a
0559:         trial: For
0560:       really this
0561:      morning I've
0562:     nothing
0563:     to do."
0564:      Said the
0565:       mouse to the
0566:        cur, "Such
0567:         a trial,
0568:          dear Sir,
0569:             With
0570:           no jury
0571:         or judge,
0572:        would be
0573:       wasting
0574:       our
0575:       breath."
0576:        "I'll be
0577:         judge, I'll
0578:          be jury,"
0579:             Said
0580:          cunning
0581:           old Fury:
0582:           "I'll
0583:           try the
0584:             whole
0585:             cause,
0586:               and
0587:            condemn
0588:            you
0589:           to
0590:            death."'
0591: 
0592: 
0593: 'You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely. 'What are you
0594: thinking of?'
0595: 
0596: 'I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: 'you had got to the fifth
0597: bend, I think?'
0598: 
0599: 'I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.
0600: 
0601: 'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
0602: anxiously about her. 'Oh, do let me help to undo it!'
0603: 
0604: 'I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up and walking
0605: away. 'You insult me by talking such nonsense!'
0606: 
0607: 'I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. 'But you're so easily offended,
0608: you know!'
0609: 
0610: The Mouse only growled in reply.
0611: 
0612: 'Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after it; and the
0613: others all joined in chorus, 'Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shook
0614: its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.
0615: 
0616: 'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite
0617: out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her
0618: daughter 'Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
0619: YOUR temper!' 'Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the young Crab, a little
0620: snappishly. 'You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!'
0621: 
0622: 'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, addressing
0623: nobody in particular. 'She'd soon fetch it back!'
0624: 
0625: 'And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?' said the
0626: Lory.
0627: 
0628: Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
0629: 'Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice you
0630: can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
0631: she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!'
0632: 
0633: This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
0634: birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
0635: carefully, remarking, 'I really must be getting home; the night-air
0636: doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to
0637: its children, 'Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!'
0638: On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.
0639: 
0640: 'I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a melancholy
0641: tone. 'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best
0642: cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
0643: any more!' And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
0644: lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard
0645: a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
0646: eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming
0647: back to finish his story.
0648: 
0649: 
0650: 
0651: 
0652: CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
0653: 
0654: It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
0655: anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
0656: it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
0657: my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
0658: ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a
0659: moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,
0660: and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
0661: nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in
0662: the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,
0663: had vanished completely.
0664: 
0665: Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
0666: called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing
0667: out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!
0668: Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once
0669: in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it
0670: had made.
0671: 
0672: 'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How
0673: surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him
0674: his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, she
0675: came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
0676: plate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in without
0677: knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
0678: real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
0679: fan and gloves.
0680: 
0681: 'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for
0682: a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she
0683: began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come
0684: here directly, and get ready for your walk!" "Coming in a minute,
0685: nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't
0686: think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it
0687: began ordering people about like that!'
0688: 
0689: By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
0690: in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs
0691: of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,
0692: and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little
0693: bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time
0694: with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it
0695: to her lips. 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said
0696: to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what
0697: this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really
0698: I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'
0699: 
0700: It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
0701: drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
0702: and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
0703: down the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't
0704: grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't
0705: drunk quite so much!'
0706: 
0707: Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
0708: and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
0709: was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
0710: one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
0711: Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
0712: of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 'Now I
0713: can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'
0714: 
0715: Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
0716: and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
0717: seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
0718: again, no wonder she felt unhappy.
0719: 
0720: 'It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, 'when one wasn't
0721: always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
0722: rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and
0723: yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
0724: CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that
0725: kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!
0726: There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I
0727: grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a sorrowful
0728: tone; 'at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE.'
0729: 
0730: 'But then,' thought Alice, 'shall I NEVER get any older than I am
0731: now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but
0732: then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'
0733: 
0734: 'Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. 'How can you learn
0735: lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all
0736: for any lesson-books!'
0737: 
0738: And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making
0739: quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard
0740: a voice outside, and stopped to listen.
0741: 
0742: 'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!'
0743: Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
0744: the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
0745: house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
0746: as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
0747: 
0748: Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
0749: the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,
0750: that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'll
0751: go round and get in at the window.'
0752: 
0753: 'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
0754: she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
0755: hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
0756: but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
0757: from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
0758: cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
0759: 
0760: Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And
0761: then a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging
0762: for apples, yer honour!'
0763: 
0764: 'Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. 'Here! Come and
0765: help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)
0766: 
0767: 'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'
0768: 
0769: 'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')
0770: 
0771: 'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
0772: window!'
0773: 
0774: 'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'
0775: 
0776: 'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'
0777: 
0778: There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
0779: now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at
0780: all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her
0781: hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
0782: TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a number of
0783: cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do
0784: next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm
0785: sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'
0786: 
0787: She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
0788: rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices
0789: all talking together: she made out the words: 'Where's the other
0790: ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill!
0791: fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em
0792: together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll
0793: do well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this
0794: rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming
0795: down! Heads below!' (a loud crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I
0796: fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I
0797: won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to
0798: go down the chimney!'
0799: 
0800: 'Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice to
0801: herself. 'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in
0802: Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
0803: I THINK I can kick a little!'
0804: 
0805: She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited
0806: till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)
0807: scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
0808: saying to herself 'This is Bill,' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to
0809: see what would happen next.
0810: 
0811: The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!'
0812: then the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then
0813: silence, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandy
0814: now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
0815: us all about it!'
0816: 
0817: Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ('That's Bill,' thought
0818: Alice,) 'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm
0819: a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me
0820: like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!'
0821: 
0822: 'So you did, old fellow!' said the others.
0823: 
0824: 'We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called
0825: out as loud as she could, 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!'
0826: 
0827: There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, 'I
0828: wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the
0829: roof off.' After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
0830: Alice heard the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.'
0831: 
0832: 'A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
0833: for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
0834: window, and some of them hit her in the face. 'I'll put a stop to this,'
0835: she said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not do that again!'
0836: which produced another dead silence.
0837: 
0838: Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
0839: little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
0840: head. 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make
0841: SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must
0842: make me smaller, I suppose.'
0843: 
0844: So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
0845: began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through
0846: the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little
0847: animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was
0848: in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
0849: something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
0850: appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
0851: safe in a thick wood.
0852: 
0853: 'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered
0854: about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second
0855: thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be
0856: the best plan.'
0857: 
0858: It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
0859: arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
0860: how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
0861: the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
0862: great hurry.
0863: 
0864: An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
0865: feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!'
0866: said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but
0867: she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be
0868: hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of
0869: all her coaxing.
0870: 
0871: Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
0872: held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
0873: all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
0874: and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
0875: to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
0876: other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
0877: over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
0878: very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
0879: moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
0880: the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
0881: little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
0882: all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
0883: its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
0884: 
0885: This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
0886: set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and
0887: till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
0888: 
0889: 'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant
0890: against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
0891: leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd
0892: only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that
0893: I've got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I
0894: suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
0895: question is, what?'
0896: 
0897: The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
0898: the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
0899: looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
0900: There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
0901: herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
0902: behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
0903: was on the top of it.
0904: 
0905: She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
0906: mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,
0907: that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long
0908: hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.
0909: 
0910: 
0911: 
0912: 
0913: CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar
0914: 
0915: The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:
0916: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed
0917: her in a languid, sleepy voice.
0918: 
0919: 'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.
0920: 
0921: This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
0922: rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know
0923: who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
0924: changed several times since then.'
0925: 
0926: 'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain
0927: yourself!'
0928: 
0929: 'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not
0930: myself, you see.'
0931: 
0932: 'I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.
0933: 
0934: 'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely,
0935: 'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
0936: different sizes in a day is very confusing.'
0937: 
0938: 'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.
0939: 
0940: 'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you
0941: have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then
0942: after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little
0943: queer, won't you?'
0944: 
0945: 'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.
0946: 
0947: 'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know
0948: is, it would feel very queer to ME.'
0949: 
0950: 'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?'
0951: 
0952: Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
0953: Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY
0954: short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think,
0955: you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'
0956: 
0957: 'Why?' said the Caterpillar.
0958: 
0959: Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
0960: good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant
0961: state of mind, she turned away.
0962: 
0963: 'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something important
0964: to say!'
0965: 
0966: This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
0967: 
0968: 'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.
0969: 
0970: 'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
0971: could.
0972: 
0973: 'No,' said the Caterpillar.
0974: 
0975: Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
0976: perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some
0977: minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its
0978: arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think
0979: you're changed, do you?'
0980: 
0981: 'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I
0982: used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'
0983: 
0984: 'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.
0985: 
0986: 'Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it all came
0987: different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
0988: 
0989: 'Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.
0990: 
0991: Alice folded her hands, and began:--
0992: 
0993:    'You are old, Father William,' the young man said,
0994:     'And your hair has become very white;
0995:    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
0996:     Do you think, at your age, it is right?'
0997: 
0998:    'In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,
0999:     'I feared it might injure the brain;
1000:    But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
1001:     Why, I do it again and again.'
1002: 
1003:    'You are old,' said the youth, 'as I mentioned before,
1004:     And have grown most uncommonly fat;
1005:    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
1006:     Pray, what is the reason of that?'
1007: 
1008:    'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
1009:     'I kept all my limbs very supple
1010:    By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
1011:     Allow me to sell you a couple?'
1012: 
1013:    'You are old,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak
1014:     For anything tougher than suet;
1015:    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
1016:     Pray how did you manage to do it?'
1017: 
1018:    'In my youth,' said his father, 'I took to the law,
1019:     And argued each case with my wife;
1020:    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
1021:     Has lasted the rest of my life.'
1022: 
1023:    'You are old,' said the youth, 'one would hardly suppose
1024:     That your eye was as steady as ever;
1025:    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
1026:     What made you so awfully clever?'
1027: 
1028:    'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'
1029:     Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs!
1030:    Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
1031:     Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'
1032: 
1033: 
1034: 'That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.
1035: 
1036: 'Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; 'some of the words
1037: have got altered.'
1038: 
1039: 'It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and
1040: there was silence for some minutes.
1041: 
1042: The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
1043: 
1044: 'What size do you want to be?' it asked.
1045: 
1046: 'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one
1047: doesn't like changing so often, you know.'
1048: 
1049: 'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
1050: 
1051: Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
1052: before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
1053: 
1054: 'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.
1055: 
1056: 'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,'
1057: said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.'
1058: 
1059: 'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing
1060: itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
1061: 
1062: 'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And
1063: she thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
1064: offended!'
1065: 
1066: 'You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the
1067: hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
1068: 
1069: This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In
1070: a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth
1071: and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
1072: mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
1073: 'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
1074: grow shorter.'
1075: 
1076: 'One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to herself.
1077: 
1078: 'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
1079: aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
1080: 
1081: Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying
1082: to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly
1083: round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she
1084: stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit
1085: of the edge with each hand.
1086: 
1087: 'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
1088: the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent
1089: blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
1090: 
1091: She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
1092: that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
1093: set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
1094: so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
1095: mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
1096: lefthand bit.
1097: 
1098: 'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, which
1099: changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
1100: were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
1101: an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
1102: sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
1103: 
1104: 'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. 'And where HAVE my
1105: shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?'
1106: She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
1107: except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
1108: 
1109: As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she
1110: tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her
1111: neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had
1112: just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going
1113: to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops
1114: of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made
1115: her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and
1116: was beating her violently with its wings.
1117: 
1118: 'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.
1119: 
1120: 'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!'
1121: 
1122: 'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,
1123: and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems
1124: to suit them!'
1125: 
1126: 'I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice.
1127: 
1128: 'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried
1129: hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those
1130: serpents! There's no pleasing them!'
1131: 
1132: Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
1133: saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
1134: 
1135: 'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon;
1136: 'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
1137: haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'
1138: 
1139: 'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to
1140: see its meaning.
1141: 
1142: 'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the
1143: Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I
1144: should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from
1145: the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'
1146: 
1147: 'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. 'I'm a--I'm a--'
1148: 
1149: 'Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. 'I can see you're trying to
1150: invent something!'
1151: 
1152: 'I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
1153: the number of changes she had gone through that day.
1154: 
1155: 'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
1156: contempt. 'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE
1157: with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use
1158: denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an
1159: egg!'
1160: 
1161: 'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful
1162: child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
1163: know.'
1164: 
1165: 'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're
1166: a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'
1167: 
1168: This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
1169: minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're
1170: looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me
1171: whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'
1172: 
1173: 'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking
1174: for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't
1175: like them raw.'
1176: 
1177: 'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
1178: down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as
1179: she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and
1180: every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she
1181: remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and
1182: she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the
1183: other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
1184: succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
1185: 
1186: It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
1187: felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
1188: and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done
1189: now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going
1190: to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right
1191: size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that
1192: to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open
1193: place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 'Whoever lives
1194: there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,
1195: I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the
1196: righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she
1197: had brought herself down to nine inches high.
1198: 
1199: 
1200: 
1201: 
1202: CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper
1203: 
1204: For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
1205: to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
1206: wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
1207: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
1208: fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened
1209: by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
1210: frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all
1211: over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,
1212: and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
1213: 
1214: The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
1215: nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
1216: saying, in a solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen
1217: to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,
1218: only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen. An
1219: invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'
1220: 
1221: Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.
1222: 
1223: Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the
1224: wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
1225: Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
1226: door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
1227: 
1228: Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
1229: 
1230: 'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for
1231: two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you
1232: are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could
1233: possibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise
1234: going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then
1235: a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.
1236: 
1237: 'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'
1238: 
1239: 'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on
1240: without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance,
1241: if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'
1242: He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this
1243: Alice thought decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she
1244: said to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.
1245: But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she
1246: repeated, aloud.
1247: 
1248: 'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--'
1249: 
1250: At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
1251: skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,
1252: and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.
1253: 
1254: '--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
1255: as if nothing had happened.
1256: 
1257: 'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
1258: 
1259: 'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. 'That's the first
1260: question, you know.'
1261: 
1262: It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 'It's really
1263: dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue.
1264: It's enough to drive one crazy!'
1265: 
1266: The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
1267: remark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for
1268: days and days.'
1269: 
1270: 'But what am I to do?' said Alice.
1271: 
1272: 'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.
1273: 
1274: 'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's
1275: perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.
1276: 
1277: The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
1278: one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in
1279: the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring
1280: a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.
1281: 
1282: 'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself,
1283: as well as she could for sneezing.
1284: 
1285: There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess
1286: sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
1287: alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen
1288: that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on
1289: the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.
1290: 
1291: 'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
1292: not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why
1293: your cat grins like that?'
1294: 
1295: 'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'
1296: 
1297: She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
1298: jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,
1299: and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--
1300: 
1301: 'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know
1302: that cats COULD grin.'
1303: 
1304: 'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'
1305: 
1306: 'I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite
1307: pleased to have got into a conversation.
1308: 
1309: 'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.'
1310: 
1311: Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
1312: be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
1313: was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
1314: fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
1315: the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a
1316: shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
1317: them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
1318: that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
1319: 
1320: 'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down in
1321: an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually
1322: large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.
1323: 
1324: 'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse
1325: growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'
1326: 
1327: 'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get
1328: an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of
1329: what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes
1330: twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--'
1331: 
1332: 'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!'
1333: 
1334: Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
1335: the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
1336: be listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is
1337: it twelve? I--'
1338: 
1339: 'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!'
1340: And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of
1341: lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of
1342: every line:
1343: 
1344:    'Speak roughly to your little boy,
1345:     And beat him when he sneezes:
1346:    He only does it to annoy,
1347:     Because he knows it teases.'
1348: 
1349:          CHORUS.
1350: 
1351:  (In which the cook and the baby joined):--
1352: 
1353:        'Wow! wow! wow!'
1354: 
1355: While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
1356: the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
1357: that Alice could hardly hear the words:--
1358: 
1359:    'I speak severely to my boy,
1360:     I beat him when he sneezes;
1361:    For he can thoroughly enjoy
1362:     The pepper when he pleases!'
1363: 
1364:          CHORUS.
1365: 
1366:        'Wow! wow! wow!'
1367: 
1368: 'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice,
1369: flinging the baby at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to play
1370: croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw
1371: a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.
1372: 
1373: Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
1374: little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just
1375: like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting
1376: like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and
1377: straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute
1378: or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
1379: 
1380: As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
1381: twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
1382: ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried
1383: it out into the open air. 'IF I don't take this child away with me,'
1384: thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be
1385: murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the
1386: little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
1387: 'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing
1388: yourself.'
1389: 
1390: The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to
1391: see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
1392: a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its
1393: eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not
1394: like the look of the thing at all. 'But perhaps it was only sobbing,'
1395: she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any
1396: tears.
1397: 
1398: No, there were no tears. 'If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,'
1399: said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
1400: now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
1401: to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.
1402: 
1403: Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do with
1404: this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently,
1405: that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could
1406: be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she
1407: felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.
1408: 
1409: So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see
1410: it trot away quietly into the wood. 'If it had grown up,' she said
1411: to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
1412: rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began thinking over other
1413: children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
1414: to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she
1415: was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a
1416: tree a few yards off.
1417: 
1418: The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
1419: thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she
1420: felt that it ought to be treated with respect.
1421: 
1422: 'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
1423: whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.
1424: 'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on. 'Would you
1425: tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'
1426: 
1427: 'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.
1428: 
1429: 'I don't much care where--' said Alice.
1430: 
1431: 'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.
1432: 
1433: '--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.
1434: 
1435: 'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long
1436: enough.'
1437: 
1438: Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.
1439: 'What sort of people live about here?'
1440: 
1441: 'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives
1442: a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March
1443: Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'
1444: 
1445: 'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.
1446: 
1447: 'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad.
1448: You're mad.'
1449: 
1450: 'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.
1451: 
1452: 'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'
1453: 
1454: Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how
1455: do you know that you're mad?'
1456: 
1457: 'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?'
1458: 
1459: 'I suppose so,' said Alice.
1460: 
1461: 'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry,
1462: and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and
1463: wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'
1464: 
1465: 'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.
1466: 
1467: 'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with the
1468: Queen to-day?'
1469: 
1470: 'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited
1471: yet.'
1472: 
1473: 'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.
1474: 
1475: Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
1476: things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
1477: it suddenly appeared again.
1478: 
1479: 'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. 'I'd nearly
1480: forgotten to ask.'
1481: 
1482: 'It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
1483: in a natural way.
1484: 
1485: 'I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.
1486: 
1487: Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
1488: appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
1489: which the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she
1490: said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
1491: perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as
1492: it was in March.' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
1493: again, sitting on a branch of a tree.
1494: 
1495: 'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.
1496: 
1497: 'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and
1498: vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'
1499: 
1500: 'All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
1501: beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
1502: remained some time after the rest of it had gone.
1503: 
1504: 'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin
1505: without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'
1506: 
1507: She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house
1508: of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
1509: chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
1510: was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
1511: nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to
1512: about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,
1513: saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost
1514: wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!'
1515: 
1516: 
1517: 
1518: 
1519: CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party
1520: 
1521: There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
1522: March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
1523: between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
1524: cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very
1525: uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I
1526: suppose it doesn't mind.'
1527: 
1528: The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
1529: one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alice
1530: coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat
1531: down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.
1532: 
1533: 'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
1534: 
1535: Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
1536: 'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.
1537: 
1538: 'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.
1539: 
1540: 'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.
1541: 
1542: 'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said
1543: the March Hare.
1544: 
1545: 'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great
1546: many more than three.'
1547: 
1548: 'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice
1549: for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.
1550: 
1551: 'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some
1552: severity; 'it's very rude.'
1553: 
1554: The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID
1555: was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'
1556: 
1557: 'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they've
1558: begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.
1559: 
1560: 'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the
1561: March Hare.
1562: 
1563: 'Exactly so,' said Alice.
1564: 
1565: 'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.
1566: 
1567: 'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I
1568: say--that's the same thing, you know.'
1569: 
1570: 'Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well say
1571: that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see"!'
1572: 
1573: 'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that "I like what I
1574: get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'
1575: 
1576: 'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
1577: talking in his sleep, 'that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thing
1578: as "I sleep when I breathe"!'
1579: 
1580: 'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the
1581: conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice
1582: thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,
1583: which wasn't much.
1584: 
1585: The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month
1586: is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
1587: pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
1588: and holding it to his ear.
1589: 
1590: Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'
1591: 
1592: 'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit
1593: the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.
1594: 
1595: 'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.
1596: 
1597: 'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled:
1598: 'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'
1599: 
1600: The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
1601: it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
1602: nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter,
1603: you know.'
1604: 
1605: Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What a
1606: funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't
1607: tell what o'clock it is!'
1608: 
1609: 'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you what
1610: year it is?'
1611: 
1612: 'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it
1613: stays the same year for such a long time together.'
1614: 
1615: 'Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.
1616: 
1617: Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no
1618: sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quite
1619: understand you,' she said, as politely as she could.
1620: 
1621: 'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little
1622: hot tea upon its nose.
1623: 
1624: The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
1625: eyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.'
1626: 
1627: 'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice
1628: again.
1629: 
1630: 'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?'
1631: 
1632: 'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.
1633: 
1634: 'Nor I,' said the March Hare.
1635: 
1636: Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the
1637: time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.'
1638: 
1639: 'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk
1640: about wasting IT. It's HIM.'
1641: 
1642: 'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.
1643: 
1644: 'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.
1645: 'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'
1646: 
1647: 'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time
1648: when I learn music.'
1649: 
1650: 'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. 'He won't stand beating.
1651: Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything
1652: you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in
1653: the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a
1654: hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
1655: time for dinner!'
1656: 
1657: ('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)
1658: 
1659: 'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I
1660: shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'
1661: 
1662: 'Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to
1663: half-past one as long as you liked.'
1664: 
1665: 'Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.
1666: 
1667: The Hatter shook his head mournfully. 'Not I!' he replied. 'We
1668: quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' (pointing
1669: with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) '--it was at the great concert
1670: given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
1671: 
1672:      "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
1673:      How I wonder what you're at!"
1674: 
1675: You know the song, perhaps?'
1676: 
1677: 'I've heard something like it,' said Alice.
1678: 
1679: 'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--
1680: 
1681:      "Up above the world you fly,
1682:      Like a tea-tray in the sky.
1683:          Twinkle, twinkle--"'
1684: 
1685: Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle,
1686: twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that they had to pinch
1687: it to make it stop.
1688: 
1689: 'Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 'when the
1690: Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the time! Off with his
1691: head!"'
1692: 
1693: 'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.
1694: 
1695: 'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't
1696: do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'
1697: 
1698: A bright idea came into Alice's head. 'Is that the reason so many
1699: tea-things are put out here?' she asked.
1700: 
1701: 'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time,
1702: and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'
1703: 
1704: 'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.
1705: 
1706: 'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get used up.'
1707: 
1708: 'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice ventured
1709: to ask.
1710: 
1711: 'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
1712: 'I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.'
1713: 
1714: 'I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at the
1715: proposal.
1716: 
1717: 'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And
1718: they pinched it on both sides at once.
1719: 
1720: The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a
1721: hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard every word you fellows were saying.'
1722: 
1723: 'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.
1724: 
1725: 'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.
1726: 
1727: 'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again
1728: before it's done.'
1729: 
1730: 'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse began
1731: in a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
1732: they lived at the bottom of a well--'
1733: 
1734: 'What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest in
1735: questions of eating and drinking.
1736: 
1737: 'They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
1738: two.
1739: 
1740: 'They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'd
1741: have been ill.'
1742: 
1743: 'So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY ill.'
1744: 
1745: Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
1746: living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But
1747: why did they live at the bottom of a well?'
1748: 
1749: 'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
1750: 
1751: 'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't
1752: take more.'
1753: 
1754: 'You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take
1755: MORE than nothing.'
1756: 
1757: 'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.
1758: 
1759: 'Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked triumphantly.
1760: 
1761: Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself
1762: to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
1763: repeated her question. 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'
1764: 
1765: The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
1766: said, 'It was a treacle-well.'
1767: 
1768: 'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
1769: Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily
1770: remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for
1771: yourself.'
1772: 
1773: 'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I
1774: dare say there may be ONE.'
1775: 
1776: 'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
1777: go on. 'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,
1778: you know--'
1779: 
1780: 'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.
1781: 
1782: 'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
1783: 
1784: 'I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one place
1785: on.'
1786: 
1787: He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
1788: moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took
1789: the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
1790: advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
1791: before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.
1792: 
1793: Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
1794: cautiously: 'But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle
1795: from?'
1796: 
1797: 'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should
1798: think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?'
1799: 
1800: 'But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to
1801: notice this last remark.
1802: 
1803: 'Of course they were', said the Dormouse; '--well in.'
1804: 
1805: This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
1806: some time without interrupting it.
1807: 
1808: 'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
1809: its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of
1810: things--everything that begins with an M--'
1811: 
1812: 'Why with an M?' said Alice.
1813: 
1814: 'Why not?' said the March Hare.
1815: 
1816: Alice was silent.
1817: 
1818: The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into
1819: a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with
1820: a little shriek, and went on: '--that begins with an M, such as
1821: mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say
1822: things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever see such a thing as a
1823: drawing of a muchness?'
1824: 
1825: 'Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, 'I don't
1826: think--'
1827: 
1828: 'Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.
1829: 
1830: This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
1831: great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
1832: neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
1833: looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
1834: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
1835: the teapot.
1836: 
1837: 'At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she picked her
1838: way through the wood. 'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all
1839: my life!'
1840: 
1841: Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
1842: leading right into it. 'That's very curious!' she thought. 'But
1843: everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.' And in
1844: she went.
1845: 
1846: Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
1847: glass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself,
1848: and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
1849: led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she
1850: had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:
1851: then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at
1852: last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool
1853: fountains.
1854: 
1855: 
1856: 
1857: 
1858: CHAPTER VIII. The Queen's Croquet-Ground
1859: 
1860: A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
1861: growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
1862: painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went
1863: nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of
1864: them say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like
1865: that!'
1866: 
1867: 'I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; 'Seven jogged my
1868: elbow.'
1869: 
1870: On which Seven looked up and said, 'That's right, Five! Always lay the
1871: blame on others!'
1872: 
1873: 'YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. 'I heard the Queen say only
1874: yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'
1875: 
1876: 'What for?' said the one who had spoken first.
1877: 
1878: 'That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.
1879: 
1880: 'Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, 'and I'll tell him--it was for
1881: bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'
1882: 
1883: Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun 'Well, of all the unjust
1884: things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
1885: them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and
1886: all of them bowed low.
1887: 
1888: 'Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, 'why you are painting
1889: those roses?'
1890: 
1891: Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
1892: voice, 'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
1893: RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
1894: was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.
1895: So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--' At this
1896: moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
1897: out 'The Queen! The Queen!' and the three gardeners instantly threw
1898: themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
1899: and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.
1900: 
1901: First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like
1902: the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
1903: corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
1904: diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
1905: the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
1906: jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented
1907: with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among
1908: them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried
1909: nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
1910: noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's
1911: crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand
1912: procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
1913: 
1914: Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
1915: like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
1916: of such a rule at processions; 'and besides, what would be the use of
1917: a procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon their
1918: faces, so that they couldn't see it?' So she stood still where she was,
1919: and waited.
1920: 
1921: When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
1922: at her, and the Queen said severely 'Who is this?' She said it to the
1923: Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.
1924: 
1925: 'Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
1926: Alice, she went on, 'What's your name, child?'
1927: 
1928: 'My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very politely;
1929: but she added, to herself, 'Why, they're only a pack of cards, after
1930: all. I needn't be afraid of them!'
1931: 
1932: 'And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who
1933: were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their
1934: faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the
1935: pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or
1936: courtiers, or three of her own children.
1937: 
1938: 'How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage. 'It's no
1939: business of MINE.'
1940: 
1941: The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
1942: moment like a wild beast, screamed 'Off with her head! Off--'
1943: 
1944: 'Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
1945: silent.
1946: 
1947: The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my
1948: dear: she is only a child!'
1949: 
1950: The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 'Turn them
1951: over!'
1952: 
1953: The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
1954: 
1955: 'Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
1956: gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
1957: the royal children, and everybody else.
1958: 
1959: 'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. 'You make me giddy.' And then,
1960: turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?'
1961: 
1962: 'May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, going
1963: down on one knee as he spoke, 'we were trying--'
1964: 
1965: 'I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
1966: 'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the
1967: soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
1968: to Alice for protection.
1969: 
1970: 'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a large
1971: flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
1972: minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
1973: others.
1974: 
1975: 'Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.
1976: 
1977: 'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted
1978: in reply.
1979: 
1980: 'That's right!' shouted the Queen. 'Can you play croquet?'
1981: 
1982: The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
1983: evidently meant for her.
1984: 
1985: 'Yes!' shouted Alice.
1986: 
1987: 'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
1988: wondering very much what would happen next.
1989: 
1990: 'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was
1991: walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.
1992: 
1993: 'Very,' said Alice: '--where's the Duchess?'
1994: 
1995: 'Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
1996: anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
1997: tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's under
1998: sentence of execution.'
1999: 
2000: 'What for?' said Alice.
2001: 
2002: 'Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.
2003: 
2004: 'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity. I said
2005: "What for?"'
2006: 
2007: 'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
2008: scream of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
2009: tone. 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
2010: Queen said--'
2011: 
2012: 'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
2013: people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
2014: other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
2015: began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in
2016: her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,
2017: the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves
2018: up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.
2019: 
2020: The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
2021: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under
2022: her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got
2023: its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a
2024: blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,
2025: with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out
2026: laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin
2027: again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
2028: itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was
2029: generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the
2030: hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up
2031: and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the
2032: conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.
2033: 
2034: The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
2035: all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short
2036: time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
2037: shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' about once in a
2038: minute.
2039: 
2040: Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
2041: dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
2042: 'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfully
2043: fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one
2044: left alive!'
2045: 
2046: She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
2047: could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance
2048: in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it
2049: a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself
2050: 'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.'
2051: 
2052: 'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
2053: enough for it to speak with.
2054: 
2055: Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. 'It's no use
2056: speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one
2057: of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
2058: down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
2059: she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was
2060: enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.
2061: 
2062: 'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a
2063: complaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear
2064: oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular;
2065: at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how
2066: confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the
2067: arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
2068: ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only
2069: it ran away when it saw mine coming!'
2070: 
2071: 'How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.
2072: 
2073: 'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed
2074: that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
2075: '--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'
2076: 
2077: The Queen smiled and passed on.
2078: 
2079: 'Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and looking
2080: at the Cat's head with great curiosity.
2081: 
2082: 'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to
2083: introduce it.'
2084: 
2085: 'I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 'however, it may
2086: kiss my hand if it likes.'
2087: 
2088: 'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.
2089: 
2090: 'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!'
2091: He got behind Alice as he spoke.
2092: 
2093: 'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book,
2094: but I don't remember where.'
2095: 
2096: 'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called
2097: the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would
2098: have this cat removed!'
2099: 
2100: The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.
2101: 'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round.
2102: 
2103: 'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he
2104: hurried off.
2105: 
2106: Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
2107: on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with
2108: passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
2109: executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
2110: of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
2111: whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.
2112: 
2113: The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
2114: to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
2115: other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the
2116: other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless
2117: sort of way to fly up into a tree.
2118: 
2119: By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
2120: was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't
2121: matter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side
2122: of the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
2123: escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
2124: friend.
2125: 
2126: When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a
2127: large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
2128: the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
2129: while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.
2130: 
2131: The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
2132: the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
2133: all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
2134: what they said.
2135: 
2136: The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless
2137: there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
2138: thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.
2139: 
2140: The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be
2141: beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.
2142: 
2143: The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less
2144: than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last
2145: remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)
2146: 
2147: Alice could think of nothing else to say but 'It belongs to the Duchess:
2148: you'd better ask HER about it.'
2149: 
2150: 'She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: 'fetch her here.'
2151: And the executioner went off like an arrow.
2152: 
2153:  The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,
2154: by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely
2155: disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down
2156: looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.
2157: 
2158: 
2159: 
2160: 
2161: CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle's Story
2162: 
2163: 'You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!'
2164: said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and
2165: they walked off together.
2166: 
2167: Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
2168: to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
2169: savage when they met in the kitchen.
2170: 
2171: 'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone
2172: though), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very
2173: well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,'
2174: she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of
2175: rule, 'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes
2176: them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children
2177: sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so
2178: stingy about it, you know--'
2179: 
2180: She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
2181: startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 'You're thinking
2182: about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't
2183: tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
2184: a bit.'
2185: 
2186: 'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.
2187: 
2188: 'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if only
2189: you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as
2190: she spoke.
2191: 
2192: Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
2193: Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
2194: right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an
2195: uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
2196: bore it as well as she could.
2197: 
2198: 'The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up
2199: the conversation a little.
2200: 
2201: ''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis love,
2202: 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'
2203: 
2204: 'Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'that it's done by everybody minding
2205: their own business!'
2206: 
2207: 'Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging her
2208: sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, 'and the moral
2209: of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
2210: themselves."'
2211: 
2212: 'How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to herself.
2213: 
2214: 'I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,'
2215: the Duchess said after a pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful about
2216: the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?'
2217: 
2218: 'HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to
2219: have the experiment tried.
2220: 
2221: 'Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
2222: the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock together."'
2223: 
2224: 'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.
2225: 
2226: 'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of
2227: putting things!'
2228: 
2229: 'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.
2230: 
2231: 'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
2232: everything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. And
2233: the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the less there is of
2234: yours."'
2235: 
2236: 'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,
2237: 'it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.'
2238: 
2239: 'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that
2240: is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put more
2241: simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
2242: appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise
2243: than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise."'
2244: 
2245: 'I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very politely, 'if
2246: I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.'
2247: 
2248: 'That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, in
2249: a pleased tone.
2250: 
2251: 'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said
2252: Alice.
2253: 
2254: 'Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. 'I make you a present
2255: of everything I've said as yet.'
2256: 
2257: 'A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they don't give
2258: birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to say it out
2259: loud.
2260: 
2261: 'Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
2262: little chin.
2263: 
2264: 'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
2265: feel a little worried.
2266: 
2267: 'Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; and
2268: the m--'
2269: 
2270: But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even
2271: in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked
2272: into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen
2273: in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.
2274: 
2275: 'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
2276: 
2277: 'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the
2278: ground as she spoke; 'either you or your head must be off, and that in
2279: about half no time! Take your choice!'
2280: 
2281: The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.
2282: 
2283: 'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was
2284: too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
2285: croquet-ground.
2286: 
2287: The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were
2288: resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
2289: back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would
2290: cost them their lives.
2291: 
2292: All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with
2293: the other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her
2294: head!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,
2295: who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by
2296: the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the
2297: players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and
2298: under sentence of execution.
2299: 
2300: Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have
2301: you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'
2302: 
2303: 'No,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'
2304: 
2305: 'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.
2306: 
2307: 'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.
2308: 
2309: 'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,'
2310: 
2311: As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
2312: to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good
2313: thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
2314: number of executions the Queen had ordered.
2315: 
2316: They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.
2317: (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy
2318: thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock
2319: Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
2320: executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with
2321: the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on
2322: the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go
2323: after that savage Queen: so she waited.
2324: 
2325: The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
2326: she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,
2327: half to itself, half to Alice.
2328: 
2329: 'What IS the fun?' said Alice.
2330: 
2331: 'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. 'It's all her fancy, that: they never
2332: executes nobody, you know. Come on!'
2333: 
2334: 'Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly
2335: after it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'
2336: 
2337: They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
2338: sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
2339: nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
2340: pitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the
2341: Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his
2342: fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'
2343: 
2344: So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
2345: full of tears, but said nothing.
2346: 
2347: 'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your
2348: history, she do.'
2349: 
2350: 'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit
2351: down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'
2352: 
2353: So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
2354: herself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' But
2355: she waited patiently.
2356: 
2357: 'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real
2358: Turtle.'
2359: 
2360: These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
2361: occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant
2362: heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
2363: saying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could
2364: not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said
2365: nothing.
2366: 
2367: 'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
2368: though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the
2369: sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--'
2370: 
2371: 'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.
2372: 
2373: 'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle
2374: angrily: 'really you are very dull!'
2375: 
2376: 'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,'
2377: added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
2378: Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said
2379: to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!'
2380: and he went on in these words:
2381: 
2382: 'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--'
2383: 
2384: 'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.
2385: 
2386: 'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.
2387: 
2388: 'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
2389: The Mock Turtle went on.
2390: 
2391: 'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--'
2392: 
2393: 'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud
2394: as all that.'
2395: 
2396: 'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
2397: 
2398: 'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.'
2399: 
2400: 'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.
2401: 
2402: 'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.
2403: 
2404: 'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in
2405: a tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,
2406: "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'
2407: 
2408: 'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of
2409: the sea.'
2410: 
2411: 'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 'I
2412: only took the regular course.'
2413: 
2414: 'What was that?' inquired Alice.
2415: 
2416: 'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle
2417: replied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,
2418: Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'
2419: 
2420: 'I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?'
2421: 
2422: The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 'What! Never heard of
2423: uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?'
2424: 
2425: 'Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'
2426: 
2427: 'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is,
2428: you ARE a simpleton.'
2429: 
2430: Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she
2431: turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?'
2432: 
2433: 'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off
2434: the subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, with
2435: Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
2436: that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
2437: Fainting in Coils.'
2438: 
2439: 'What was THAT like?' said Alice.
2440: 
2441: 'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too
2442: stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'
2443: 
2444: 'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though.
2445: He was an old crab, HE was.'
2446: 
2447: 'I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taught
2448: Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'
2449: 
2450: 'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
2451: creatures hid their faces in their paws.
2452: 
2453: 'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to
2454: change the subject.
2455: 
2456: 'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so
2457: on.'
2458: 
2459: 'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.
2460: 
2461: 'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked:
2462: 'because they lessen from day to day.'
2463: 
2464: This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
2465: before she made her next remark. 'Then the eleventh day must have been a
2466: holiday?'
2467: 
2468: 'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.
2469: 
2470: 'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.
2471: 
2472: 'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided
2473: tone: 'tell her something about the games now.'
2474: 
2475: 
2476: 
2477: 
2478: CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille
2479: 
2480: The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
2481: his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
2482: two sobs choked his voice. 'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,'
2483: said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
2484: the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
2485: running down his cheeks, he went on again:--
2486: 
2487: 'You may not have lived much under the sea--' ('I haven't,' said
2488: Alice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'
2489: (Alice began to say 'I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, and
2490: said 'No, never') '--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
2491: Lobster Quadrille is!'
2492: 
2493: 'No, indeed,' said Alice. 'What sort of a dance is it?'
2494: 
2495: 'Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you first form into a line along the
2496: sea-shore--'
2497: 
2498: 'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. 'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
2499: then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'
2500: 
2501: 'THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.
2502: 
2503: '--you advance twice--'
2504: 
2505: 'Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.
2506: 
2507: 'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partners--'
2508: 
2509: '--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon.
2510: 
2511: 'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, 'you throw the--'
2512: 
2513: 'The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.
2514: 
2515: '--as far out to sea as you can--'
2516: 
2517: 'Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.
2518: 
2519: 'Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
2520: about.
2521: 
2522: 'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.
2523: 
2524: 'Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the Mock
2525: Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been
2526: jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly
2527: and quietly, and looked at Alice.
2528: 
2529: 'It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.
2530: 
2531: 'Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.
2532: 
2533: 'Very much indeed,' said Alice.
2534: 
2535: 'Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.
2536: 'We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?'
2537: 
2538: 'Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. 'I've forgotten the words.'
2539: 
2540: So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
2541: then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
2542: forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
2543: and sadly:--
2544: 
2545:  '"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.
2546:  "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.
2547: 
2548:  See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
2549:  They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?
2550: 
2551:  Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
2552:  Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?
2553: 
2554:  "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
2555:  When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!"
2556:  But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance--
2557:  Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
2558: 
2559:  Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
2560:  Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.
2561: 
2562:  '"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.
2563:  "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
2564:  The further off from England the nearer is to France--
2565:  Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
2566: 
2567:  Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
2568:  Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?"'
2569: 
2570: 'Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said Alice, feeling
2571: very glad that it was over at last: 'and I do so like that curious song
2572: about the whiting!'
2573: 
2574: 'Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, 'they--you've seen them,
2575: of course?'
2576: 
2577: 'Yes,' said Alice, 'I've often seen them at dinn--' she checked herself
2578: hastily.
2579: 
2580: 'I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, 'but if you've
2581: seen them so often, of course you know what they're like.'
2582: 
2583: 'I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. 'They have their tails in
2584: their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'
2585: 
2586: 'You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: 'crumbs would all
2587: wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the
2588: reason is--' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--'Tell her
2589: about the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon.
2590: 
2591: 'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they WOULD go with the lobsters
2592: to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long
2593: way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get
2594: them out again. That's all.'
2595: 
2596: 'Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's very interesting. I never knew so much
2597: about a whiting before.'
2598: 
2599: 'I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the Gryphon. 'Do you
2600: know why it's called a whiting?'
2601: 
2602: 'I never thought about it,' said Alice. 'Why?'
2603: 
2604: 'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly.
2605: 
2606: Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated
2607: in a wondering tone.
2608: 
2609: 'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. 'I mean, what
2610: makes them so shiny?'
2611: 
2612: Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
2613: answer. 'They're done with blacking, I believe.'
2614: 
2615: 'Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
2616: 'are done with a whiting. Now you know.'
2617: 
2618: 'And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.
2619: 
2620: 'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
2621: 'any shrimp could have told you that.'
2622: 
2623: 'If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running
2624: on the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep back, please: we
2625: don't want YOU with us!"'
2626: 
2627: 'They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle said: 'no
2628: wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'
2629: 
2630: 'Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.
2631: 
2632: 'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to ME, and
2633: told me he was going a journey, I should say "With what porpoise?"'
2634: 
2635: 'Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.
2636: 
2637: 'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
2638: the Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures.'
2639: 
2640: 'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' said
2641: Alice a little timidly: 'but it's no use going back to yesterday,
2642: because I was a different person then.'
2643: 
2644: 'Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.
2645: 
2646: 'No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
2647: 'explanations take such a dreadful time.'
2648: 
2649: So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
2650: saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
2651: the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
2652: their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went
2653: on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
2654: her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the
2655: words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,
2656: and said 'That's very curious.'
2657: 
2658: 'It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.
2659: 
2660: 'It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. 'I
2661: should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
2662: begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
2663: authority over Alice.
2664: 
2665: 'Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said the
2666: Gryphon.
2667: 
2668: 'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!'
2669: thought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.' However, she
2670: got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
2671: Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
2672: very queer indeed:--
2673: 
2674:   ''Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
2675:   "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
2676:   As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
2677:   Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'
2678: 
2679:        [later editions continued as follows
2680:   When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
2681:   And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
2682:   But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
2683:   His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]
2684: 
2685: 'That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said the
2686: Gryphon.
2687: 
2688: 'Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; 'but it sounds
2689: uncommon nonsense.'
2690: 
2691: Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
2692: wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.
2693: 
2694: 'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.
2695: 
2696: 'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the next
2697: verse.'
2698: 
2699: 'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn them
2700: out with his nose, you know?'
2701: 
2702: 'It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was dreadfully
2703: puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.
2704: 
2705: 'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it
2706: begins "I passed by his garden."'
2707: 
2708: Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
2709: wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--
2710: 
2711:   'I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
2712:   How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'
2713: 
2714:     [later editions continued as follows
2715:   The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
2716:   While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
2717:   When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
2718:   Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
2719:   While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
2720:   And concluded the banquet--]
2721: 
2722: 'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle
2723: interrupted, 'if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most
2724: confusing thing I ever heard!'
2725: 
2726: 'Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and Alice was
2727: only too glad to do so.
2728: 
2729: 'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon went
2730: on. 'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'
2731: 
2732: 'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' Alice
2733: replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
2734: 'Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her "Turtle Soup," will you, old
2735: fellow?'
2736: 
2737: The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
2738: with sobs, to sing this:--
2739: 
2740:    'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
2741:    Waiting in a hot tureen!
2742:    Who for such dainties would not stoop?
2743:    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
2744:    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
2745:      Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
2746:      Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
2747:    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
2748:      Beautiful, beautiful Soup!
2749: 
2750:    'Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
2751:    Game, or any other dish?
2752:    Who would not give all else for two
2753:    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
2754:    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
2755:      Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
2756:      Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
2757:    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
2758:      Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'
2759: 
2760: 'Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
2761: to repeat it, when a cry of 'The trial's beginning!' was heard in the
2762: distance.
2763: 
2764: 'Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
2765: off, without waiting for the end of the song.
2766: 
2767: 'What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
2768: answered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
2769: came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--
2770: 
2771:    'Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
2772:      Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'
2773: 
2774: 
2775: 
2776: 
2777: CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?
2778: 
2779: The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
2780: arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little
2781: birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
2782: standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
2783: him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,
2784: and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court
2785: was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,
2786: that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the
2787: trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there
2788: seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about
2789: her, to pass away the time.
2790: 
2791: Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
2792: about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
2793: the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to
2794: herself, 'because of his great wig.'
2795: 
2796: The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
2797: wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did
2798: not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.
2799: 
2800: 'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'
2801: (she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were
2802: animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said
2803: this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of
2804: it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her
2805: age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done
2806: just as well.
2807: 
2808: The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they
2809: doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put
2810: down yet, before the trial's begun.'
2811: 
2812: 'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for
2813: fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'
2814: 
2815: 'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped
2816: hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the
2817: King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who
2818: was talking.
2819: 
2820: Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
2821: that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,
2822: and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell
2823: 'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice
2824: muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.
2825: 
2826: One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
2827: could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
2828: very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
2829: that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
2830: at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was
2831: obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was
2832: of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.
2833: 
2834: 'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.
2835: 
2836: On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
2837: unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--
2838: 
2839:    'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
2840:       All on a summer day:
2841:     The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
2842:       And took them quite away!'
2843: 
2844: 'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.
2845: 
2846: 'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great
2847: deal to come before that!'
2848: 
2849: 'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three
2850: blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'
2851: 
2852: The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one
2853: hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your
2854: Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished
2855: my tea when I was sent for.'
2856: 
2857: 'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'
2858: 
2859: The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
2860: court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it
2861: was,' he said.
2862: 
2863: 'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.
2864: 
2865: 'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.
2866: 
2867: 'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
2868: wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
2869: reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
2870: 
2871: 'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.
2872: 
2873: 'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.
2874: 
2875: 'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a
2876: memorandum of the fact.
2877: 
2878: 'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of
2879: my own. I'm a hatter.'
2880: 
2881: Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
2882: who turned pale and fidgeted.
2883: 
2884: 'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have
2885: you executed on the spot.'
2886: 
2887: This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
2888: from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in
2889: his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
2890: bread-and-butter.
2891: 
2892: Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
2893: her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
2894: grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
2895: the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
2896: long as there was room for her.
2897: 
2898: 'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting
2899: next to her. 'I can hardly breathe.'
2900: 
2901: 'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'
2902: 
2903: 'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.
2904: 
2905: 'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing
2906: too.'
2907: 
2908: 'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that
2909: ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the
2910: other side of the court.
2911: 
2912: All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
2913: just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
2914: of the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on
2915: which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.
2916: 
2917: 'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you
2918: executed, whether you're nervous or not.'
2919: 
2920: 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
2921: '--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the
2922: bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'
2923: 
2924: 'The twinkling of the what?' said the King.
2925: 
2926: 'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.
2927: 
2928: 'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do you
2929: take me for a dunce? Go on!'
2930: 
2931: 'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after
2932: that--only the March Hare said--'
2933: 
2934: 'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.
2935: 
2936: 'You did!' said the Hatter.
2937: 
2938: 'I deny it!' said the March Hare.
2939: 
2940: 'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'
2941: 
2942: 'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking
2943: anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
2944: nothing, being fast asleep.
2945: 
2946: 'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'
2947: 
2948: 'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.
2949: 
2950: 'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.
2951: 
2952: 'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'
2953: 
2954: The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
2955: down on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.
2956: 
2957: 'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.
2958: 
2959: Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
2960: the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
2961: explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
2962: up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
2963: head first, and then sat upon it.)
2964: 
2965: 'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read
2966: in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some attempts
2967: at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
2968: court," and I never understood what it meant till now.'
2969: 
2970: 'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the
2971: King.
2972: 
2973: 'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the floor, as it is.'
2974: 
2975: 'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.
2976: 
2977: Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
2978: 
2979: 'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall get
2980: on better.'
2981: 
2982: 'I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the
2983: Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
2984: 
2985: 'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
2986: without even waiting to put his shoes on.
2987: 
2988: '--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the
2989: officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
2990: to the door.
2991: 
2992: 'Call the next witness!' said the King.
2993: 
2994: The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in
2995: her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
2996: court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
2997: 
2998: 'Give your evidence,' said the King.
2999: 
3000: 'Shan't,' said the cook.
3001: 
3002: The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
3003: 'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'
3004: 
3005: 'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
3006: after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
3007: nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?'
3008: 
3009: 'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.
3010: 
3011: 'Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.
3012: 
3013: 'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. 'Behead that Dormouse!
3014: Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
3015: whiskers!'
3016: 
3017: For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
3018: turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
3019: disappeared.
3020: 
3021: 'Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief. 'Call the next
3022: witness.' And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear,
3023: YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead
3024: ache!'
3025: 
3026: Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very
3027: curious to see what the next witness would be like, '--for they haven't
3028: got much evidence YET,' she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when
3029: the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the
3030: name 'Alice!'
3031: 
3032: 
3033: 
3034: 
3035: CHAPTER XII. Alice's Evidence
3036: 
3037: 
3038: 'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
3039: large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
3040: a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
3041: upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
3042: they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish
3043: she had accidentally upset the week before.
3044: 
3045: 'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
3046: began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of
3047: the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea
3048: that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or
3049: they would die.
3050: 
3051: 'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until
3052: all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,' he repeated with
3053: great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.
3054: 
3055: Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
3056: the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
3057: tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got
3058: it out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said
3059: to herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial
3060: one way up as the other.'
3061: 
3062: As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
3063: upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
3064: them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
3065: accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
3066: anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
3067: court.
3068: 
3069: 'What do you know about this business?' the King said to Alice.
3070: 
3071: 'Nothing,' said Alice.
3072: 
3073: 'Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.
3074: 
3075: 'Nothing whatever,' said Alice.
3076: 
3077: 'That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury. They were
3078: just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit
3079: interrupted: 'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a
3080: very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.
3081: 
3082: 'UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on
3083: to himself in an undertone,
3084: 
3085: 'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as if he were trying
3086: which word sounded best.
3087: 
3088: Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.'
3089: Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
3090: 'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself.
3091: 
3092: At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
3093: his note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'Rule
3094: Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'
3095: 
3096: Everybody looked at Alice.
3097: 
3098: 'I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.
3099: 
3100: 'You are,' said the King.
3101: 
3102: 'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.
3103: 
3104: 'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not a
3105: regular rule: you invented it just now.'
3106: 
3107: 'It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.
3108: 
3109: 'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.
3110: 
3111: The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider your
3112: verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
3113: 
3114: 'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the White
3115: Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; 'this paper has just been picked
3116: up.'
3117: 
3118: 'What's in it?' said the Queen.
3119: 
3120: 'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be a
3121: letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'
3122: 
3123: 'It must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was written to
3124: nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'
3125: 
3126: 'Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.
3127: 
3128: 'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's
3129: nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and
3130: added 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'
3131: 
3132: 'Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the jurymen.
3133: 
3134: 'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thing
3135: about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)
3136: 
3137: 'He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King. (The jury
3138: all brightened up again.)
3139: 
3140: 'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I didn't write it, and they
3141: can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'
3142: 
3143: 'If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that only makes the matter
3144: worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your
3145: name like an honest man.'
3146: 
3147: There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
3148: clever thing the King had said that day.
3149: 
3150: 'That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.
3151: 
3152: 'It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. 'Why, you don't even know
3153: what they're about!'
3154: 
3155: 'Read them,' said the King.
3156: 
3157: The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please
3158: your Majesty?' he asked.
3159: 
3160: 'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till you
3161: come to the end: then stop.'
3162: 
3163: These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--
3164: 
3165:    'They told me you had been to her,
3166:     And mentioned me to him:
3167:    She gave me a good character,
3168:     But said I could not swim.
3169: 
3170:    He sent them word I had not gone
3171:     (We know it to be true):
3172:    If she should push the matter on,
3173:     What would become of you?
3174: 
3175:    I gave her one, they gave him two,
3176:     You gave us three or more;
3177:    They all returned from him to you,
3178:     Though they were mine before.
3179: 
3180:    If I or she should chance to be
3181:     Involved in this affair,
3182:    He trusts to you to set them free,
3183:     Exactly as we were.
3184: 
3185:    My notion was that you had been
3186:     (Before she had this fit)
3187:    An obstacle that came between
3188:     Him, and ourselves, and it.
3189: 
3190:    Don't let him know she liked them best,
3191:     For this must ever be
3192:    A secret, kept from all the rest,
3193:     Between yourself and me.'
3194: 
3195: 'That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the
3196: King, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury--'
3197: 
3198: 'If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large
3199: in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting
3200: him,) 'I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of
3201: meaning in it.'
3202: 
3203: The jury all wrote down on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an
3204: atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.
3205: 
3206: 'If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, 'that saves a world of
3207: trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,'
3208: he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them
3209: with one eye; 'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAID
3210: I COULD NOT SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the
3211: Knave.
3212: 
3213: The Knave shook his head sadly. 'Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he
3214: certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)
3215: 
3216: 'All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over
3217: the verses to himself: '"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of
3218: course--"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he
3219: did with the tarts, you know--'
3220: 
3221: 'But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice.
3222: 
3223: 'Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts
3224: on the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHE
3225: HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the
3226: Queen.
3227: 
3228: 'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
3229: as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
3230: slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
3231: began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as
3232: it lasted.)
3233: 
3234: 'Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court
3235: with a smile. There was a dead silence.
3236: 
3237: 'It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,
3238: 'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the
3239: twentieth time that day.
3240: 
3241: 'No, no!' said the Queen. 'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'
3242: 
3243: 'Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. 'The idea of having the
3244: sentence first!'
3245: 
3246: 'Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.
3247: 
3248: 'I won't!' said Alice.
3249: 
3250: 'Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
3251: moved.
3252: 
3253: 'Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this
3254: time.) 'You're nothing but a pack of cards!'
3255: 
3256: At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
3257: her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
3258: tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
3259: head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
3260: leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.
3261: 
3262: 'Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; 'Why, what a long sleep you've
3263: had!'
3264: 
3265: 'Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her
3266: sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures
3267: of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had
3268: finished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It WAS a curious dream,
3269: dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So
3270: Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
3271: what a wonderful dream it had been.
3272: 
3273: But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
3274: hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her
3275: wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and
3276: this was her dream:--
3277: 
3278: First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
3279: hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking
3280: up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that
3281: queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
3282: WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to
3283: listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures
3284: of her little sister's dream.
3285: 
3286: The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the
3287: frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
3288: could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
3289: shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
3290: ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
3291: was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed
3292: around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
3293: Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
3294: filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
3295: Turtle.
3296: 
3297: So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
3298: Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
3299: would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the
3300: wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling
3301: teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill
3302: cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the
3303: shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she
3304: knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing
3305: of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's
3306: heavy sobs.
3307: 
3308: Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
3309: would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
3310: keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
3311: childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and
3312: make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even
3313: with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with
3314: all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
3315: remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
3316: 
3317:               THE END
